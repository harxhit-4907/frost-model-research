# frost-model-research

Research and modeling half of a 2-person IoT frost/cold-injury alert
project for agriculture (deployment target: Warora/Vidarbha, Maharashtra).
A companion repo, `frost-edge-system` (Repo B), runs on the Raspberry Pi —
sensors, dashboard, alerts. This repo's job is to figure out, from data and
literature, what actually predicts frost/cold risk, and to hand Repo B a
trained model plus a feature list it can act on.

**Operating principle:** research → dataset → baseline → model → *then*
sensors get chosen. Feature-importance results here drive what hardware
Repo B buys, not the other way around.

## Regional framing

Warora/Vidarbha leans toward heatwave/drought/occasional cold-wave citrus
damage rather than classic sub-zero radiation frost. The pipeline is the
same either way — the label threshold is a config value, not a different
model — but pick one framing explicitly with your guide before treating
`label_rules.py`'s defaults as final:

- **General-purpose frost model** (Tmin < 0°C or similar), validated on
  foreign/threshold-derived data, deployed locally as proof-of-concept.
- **Cold-injury / minimum-temperature risk alert** for a specific local
  crop (e.g. citrus), using a documented chilling-injury threshold above
  0°C (commonly 2–5°C in horticultural literature).

## Label strategy

Labels are *computed* from raw temperature (and, for one variant, dew
point) — not learned, clustered, or taken from a dataset column. Two
validated variants (Omazić et al. 2024, *Agricultural and Forest
Meteorology*) are implemented in `src/label_rules.py` and reported
side by side, since they diverge for a real physical reason:

| Variant | Rule | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Broad** | `Tmin < 3°C` | Also catches *black frost* (crop damage with no visible ice, air too dry to form it). Higher recall against real cold-injury risk. |
| **Strict** | `Tmin < 3°C AND Td < 0°C` (Td from Tmin + daily-mean RH) | The paper's best-validated rule against *observed* frost (POD 0.98, POFD 0.18). Tuned to visible (white) frost — under-catches black frost by construction. |

See `notebooks/02_label_definition.ipynb` for the full derivation and a
worked example of where the two variants disagree.

## Data strategy

Three tiers, one consistent label rule so results stay comparable:

1. **Tier 1** (done): [florian-huber/weather_prediction_dataset](https://github.com/florian-huber/weather_prediction_dataset) —
   daily data, 18 European cities, 2000–2010. No frost label; derived via
   the threshold rules above. Used to get the whole pipeline running
   end-to-end on real data.
2. **Tier 2** (time-boxed): a dataset with *real recorded* frost labels —
   Korea ASOS (Noh et al. 2021) or Murcia, Spain (Guillén-Navarro et al.
   2019), if accessible within a few days. Croatian DHMZ data is
   confirmed unavailable (the paper's own Data Availability statement) —
   not pursued.
3. **Tier 3** (weeks 9–10): NASA POWER / AgERA5 grid cell nearest
   Warora/Vidarbha, or a real station via NOAA's Integrated Surface
   Database / GHCNh if one exists nearby. Framed explicitly as a
   calibration/transfer exercise, not a validated local benchmark.

## Cross-repo contract

`src/features.py` is the single source of truth for feature engineering.
Repo B's `feature_pipeline.py` must reproduce it exactly — same lag
windows, same rolling stats, same units, same column names (documented at
the top of `features.py`). Functions there are kept small and pure
specifically so they can be ported/imported directly rather than
re-implemented from memory.

**Unit gotcha worth knowing before touching a new dataset:** in the Tier-1
CSV, `<CITY>_humidity` is a 0–1 fraction, not a percentage, and
`cloud_cover` is in oktas (0–8), not percent. `get_city_frame()` in
`data_loader.py` derives a `humidity_pct` (0–100) column specifically so
this doesn't get silently fed into a dew-point formula at the wrong scale.

## Status

- [x] Repo structure
- [x] Tier-1 data pulled, loading/per-city extraction working
      (`src/data_loader.py`)
- [x] EDA: distributions, missingness (none in Tier 1), class balance,
      multi-city column-availability scan (`01_eda.ipynb`)
- [x] Both label variants implemented and compared (`src/label_rules.py`,
      `02_label_definition.ipynb`)
- [x] `features.py` core functions: dew point, lag, rolling, rate of
      change, cyclical time encoding — unit-tested
- [x] Phase 1 baselines: persistence, physical/threshold, logistic
      regression, all logged to `experiments/runs.csv`
      (`src/baselines.py`, `03_baselines.ipynb`)
- [x] Phase 2: feature engineering across 4 cities (Basel, Oslo,
      Perpignan, De Bilt), train/val/test tables saved to `data/processed/`
      (`04_feature_engineering.ipynb`) — a plain linear-regression sanity
      check already beats persistence (MAE 1.99°C vs 2.11°C), a good sign
      heading into Phase 3
- [x] Phase 3: RF/XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost models — all beat Persistence
      on the same 4-city test set (`src/models.py`,
      `05_model_training.ipynb`); feature importance run, wind flagged as
      "nice-to-have, not must-have" for Repo B pending Tier 3 confirmation
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning on `val.csv` (currently unused)
- [ ] Regional calibration on Tier 3 data (`06_regional_calibration.ipynb`)
- [ ] `src/export_model.py`, feature-importance handoff to Repo B
- [ ] Inference latency/memory benchmark on the actual Pi

## Out of scope this semester

No sensor network, no multi-node deployment, no solar-power modeling, no
computer-vision frost verification. These are future-work material for
the report, not this semester's build.
